# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* "Image if you returned home one day only to find out that all of your money vanished and all that's left in your bank account are a bunch of toys."

## Product
* Responsiveness.
* Tap on navbars (and internal links if needed)
* Tap on accordions to show information.

## Process
* Before // Mention learning HTML/CSS/GIT commands
* During // Wireframes
* Code snipplet: Radical Linear Gradient

## Conclusion
* Takeaways
  * Look online for people who have posted the same question in the past.
  * Don't be afraid to try things out (Didn't know how to use accordions prior to starting to code this website)
* "Thank You"

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
