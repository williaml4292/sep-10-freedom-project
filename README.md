# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **William Li**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Finance**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Jekyll** in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Parents wouldn't be forced to **supervise** their children whenever they want to shop.
  * Children would feel more _trusted_, leading to _better **relationships**_ with their parents.
* People would overall spend their money more **efficiently**.
* People would be _more aware_ of how to **manage** their money.
* More people would use **budgetting apps** so they wouldn't waste their money on unnecessary things.
* If delivery packages were to be directly _teleported_, there would practically be no way for them to be stolen.
##### CONS
* Might have to wait for a **very long time** for the inventions to actually come out.
* All the tools mentioned are on social media, so more people would be _staring at their phones_ whenever they go out to shop.
  * Could easily lead to *traffic accidents* if people stare at the phones while walking across the street.
* Most of the future inventions are going to be **expensive**, so people who aren't well off wouldn't be able to _afford_ them.
