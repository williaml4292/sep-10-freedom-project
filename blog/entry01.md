# Entry 1: Picking a Topic (Finance)
##### 10/7/24

## Choosing a topic
At first, I didn't really know what topic I wanted to do, as we weren't allowed to pick topics that were exclusively just technology. However, I took [this quiz](http://explorecareers.com/career-quiz) and found three different topics that were interesting for me:  
1. Science  
2. Finance
3. Engineering
   
Out of these three topics, I picked finance because, compared to the other two topics, it was a concept that I had no experience in. It was also something that I could be passionate about since it worked with money and was something that everyone needed an understanding of when they become adults, even if they don't get a job related to finance in the future. Furthermore, I originally was really interested in the stock market anyways, as it required a lot of analyzing to succeed. However, the article that made me the most inclined to pick finance was [this one,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp) especially when the article mentioned the use of artificial intelligence for behavioral analytics.
