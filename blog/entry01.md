# Entry 1: Picking a Topic (Finance)
##### 10/7/24

## Choosing a topic
At first, I didn't really know what topic I wanted to do, as we weren't allowed to pick topics that were exclusively just technology. However, I took [this quiz](http://explorecareers.com/career-quiz) and found three different topics that were interesting for me:  
1. Science  
2. Finance
3. Engineering
   
Out of these three topics, I picked finance because, compared to the other two topics, it was a concept that I had no experience in. It was also something that I could be passionate about since it worked with money and was something that everyone needed an understanding of when they become adults, even if they don't get a job related to finance in the future. Furthermore, I originally was really interested in the stock market anyways, as according to [this article,](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/102914/technical-analysis-strategies-beginners.asp) it required a lot of analyzing to succeed. However, the article that made me the most inclined to pick finance was [this one,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fintech.asp) especially when the article mentioned the use of artificial intelligence for behavioral analytics.

## Engineering Design Process  
I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, which is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve is that not enough people know how to manage their money and end up in debt or wasting a lot of money. Furthermore, by the time you're an adult you need to understand the basics of finance, as it would be too late to start learning it when you're already living by yourself. The next stage would be to research the problem. I plan to find various articles and websites on the internet.

## Skills  
Some skills that I have learned when working on this blog and researching topics are **How to Google** and **How to read.**

### How to Google  
A skill that I have learned is **How to Google.** When I search up: **_How technology changes finance_**, it simply takes too much time to do. During class, I learned how to google faster, without typing an entire sentence into the search bar, instead, I can just search: **_technology + finance_**. Although it might only save a few seconds, during my entire life, I definitely would at least save hours, maybe even days when I don't have to type an entire sentence out in the search bar.

### How to read
Another skill that I have learned is **How to read.** During my time reading articles to find topics for the _freedom project_, it was very annoying to find sections in the article that actually talked about the different technologies used in finance. However, I suddenly remembered a feature that I used in _google docs_ before, _ctrl + f_. I tried it in an article, and it worked. I was able to read key points in the article much faster than when I was just scrolling through the article, reading everything inside.
