##### In-class Presentation
A few takeaways that I have from giving my _[in-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wy3WiXNkB_8rEn6tiTTZ2lHe9es2cUCG_L_MTVyOZwY/edit?usp=sharing)_ are:  
* Try **not** to **stop talking**.
  * Even if what you're talking about is something that you're unsure of, you **must** keep talking so that no one _loses interest_.
* Do not rush through your **product**.
  * If I _rushed through my product_, my presentation would **barely** be **2.5** minutes, less than the required **3** minutes.
* Do **not** put _too many links_ in your presentation; **one** link for your _[actual website](https://williaml4292.github.io/sep-10-freedom-project/)_ is **enough**.
  * During my presentation, due to the sheer amount of links I had, _slideshow_ was only on for about **40%** of the time.

#### EDP 
I am currently in the **8th** stage of the _Engineering Design Process_, which is **communicating** the **results** with others. I've already _presented in class_, but I still haven't presented my **Expo elevator pitch**, so that would be the next step... after **improving** my presentation with the feedback given. Therefore, my next step of the _Engineering Design Process_ is to **improve my presentation**.

#### Skills
Two skills that I've developed since the previous entry are **communication** and **consideration**.  
##### Communcation 
Given that we were doing **presentations** we must learn how to _communicate and articulate_ our ideas with others.  
During class, Mr. Mueller spent around **30 minutes** in total giving us **tips** about what we **should** do during presentations.  
These tips include:  
* Talk **loudly** so that everyone can hear you.
> (Not too loudly)
* On [google slides](https://workspace.google.com/products/slides/), make sure that you can _read the text from the sidebar_ on the left.
  * If the text is **readable**, then everyone in the room _should be able to see your presentation_.
* Do **not** make a **wall of text**.
  * Your listeners' interest will quickly **dissipate** and no one would actually read the text.
* The **tone** that you use to present matters.
  * Your listeners will **not be more enthusiastic** than you.
In our presentation, we had a **microphone**, so we didn't need to speak too loudly.

When making my presentation, I made sure that you could _read the text from the **sidebar**_, even if the _amount of content_ on each _individual slide was very little_.  
I also made sure not to put a **wall of text** on each slide, instead, I tried to explain it **audibly** so as to not bore my classmates to death.
