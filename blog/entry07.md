##### In-class Presentation
A few takeaways that I have from giving my _[in-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wy3WiXNkB_8rEn6tiTTZ2lHe9es2cUCG_L_MTVyOZwY/edit?usp=sharing)_ are:
* Try **not** to **stop talking**.
  * Even if what you're talking about is something that you're unsure of, you **must** keep talking so that no one _loses interest_.
* Do not rush through your **product**.
  * If I _rushed through my product_, my presentation would **barely** be **2.5** minutes, less than the required **3** minutes.
* Do **not** put _too many links_ in your presentation; **one** link for your _[actual website](https://williaml4292.github.io/sep-10-freedom-project/)_ is **enough**.
  * During my presentation, due to the sheer amount of links I had, _slideshow_ was only on for about **40%** of the time.
