### Freedom Project Tool
The tool that I decided to _learn_ about was **Jekyll**. This is a tool that _automatically_ converts **markdown** into **HTML**.

In order to find out _basic information_ on how to use this tool, I went directly to [their main site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/), and **read** through the list of commands. From this, I realized that the **most important** 
commands in Jekyll were `jekyll new PATH` and `jekyll s`.

  * This creates a new directory with all the **default files needed to use Jekyll.**
  * `PATH` is the _name._
* `jekyll s`
  * Basically `http-server` but for Jekyll:
