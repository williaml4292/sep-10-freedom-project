### Part B: Potential future inventions
When I was first working on _Part B_, I was mainly thinking of **artificial intelligence**, as it's probably the easiest way to incoporate the word, _future_, with _inventions_, as it's just **adding** _artificial intelligence_ to **already existing** things.  
Here's what I came up with:
* _The Financial Phone_
  * Basicially, it's a normal phone, but with a chip built into it that uses artificial intelligence to track and budget your money.
* _The Finance Limiter Drone_
  * Questions teenagers on whether or not they really want to purchase a specific item and tells them why they shouldn't.
  * Allows parents to manage how much money their children can spend and if they are allowed to purchase an item.
  * Parents can do this from anywhere, even at work.
    
After getting these first two inventions, I began to think about **ideas** _that did not use artificial intelligence and might very well be impossible._
These include:
* A financial DNA modification
  * Allows you easily remember every single purchase you've ever made and makes it far easier to manage your budget.
* Teleporting delivery packages
  * Allows you to teleport packages to companies from anywhere in the world.
    
After I finished brainstorming all these inventions, I began to finalize my website.
To start off, I needed to figure out what I was _lacking_ in my **content**. In order to figure this out, I went back to a **graded** _Part A_ assignment, where it became very clear to me that the applications and hardware that I found in _Part A_ had **absolutely no details** whatsoever. To fix this, I spent the next 3 and a half hours on [the site where I found all my apps](https://post.edu/blog/10-best-budgeting-apps-for-college-students/) and [many](https://www.usaid.gov/energy/powering-health/system-components/uninterruptible-power-supplies) [different](https://www.fcc.gov/general/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip) [sites](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/networking/how-does-a-router-work.html) [where](https://rocketgraphics.co.uk/news/what-is-signage/) [I](https://phys.org/tags/liquid+crystal+displays/) [found](https://kcpos.co.uk/news/what-is-the-difference-epos-vs-pos/) [information](https://www.copyproductsinc.com/the-benefits-of-interactive-whiteboards-for-business/) for all the hardware.  
To add the new information that I collected into my **content**, I added 1-3 bullet points for each of the apps and hardware that I had and added the information I found in the sites.
### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am currently in the **third** step of the Engineering Design Process, which is to _brainstorm possible solutions_ to my problem. I came up with 4 different possible solutions to my problem, two of them involving artificial intelligence, while the other two do not. These were _The Financial Phone_, _The Financial Limiter Drone_, a financial DNA modification, and the teleportation of delivery packages as mentioned previously. The next step would be finding out which one of these solutions would be the most effective and most plausible to do. I plan to decide between the drone and the phone because the other two simply do not seem possible with our current technology.
### Skills
Some skills that I have developed since the previous blog are **consideration** and **creativity**.
