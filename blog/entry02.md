# Entry 2: Finding Software and Hardware used in Finance

### Software and Hardware in Finance
When I first started trying to find software and hardware used in finance, I had difficulty finding software, as most of the time, I really didn't want to include the information I found into my future website.  
My first google search was: **Finance + Software**, however it led to sites with _advertisements_ all over them, so I skipped them.  
My second search was: **What software is used in Finance? .edu**. This search actually led to [a website](https://online.sbu.edu/news/finance-tools) that contained many different tools that are used in Finance.   
These include:
* Microsoft Excel
* Bloomberg Terminal
* Tableau
* SAP
However, I probably will not include these on my website, as although **tools** are extremely similar to **software**, they are, in the end, not the same.  
My third search was: **What apps are used in Finance? .edu**. In this search, I managed to find [this website](https://post.edu/blog/10-best-budgeting-apps-for-college-students/), which
contained many different budgetting apps such as:
* Mint
* Wally
* Personal Capital
* EveryDollar
* Albert
* Dollarbird
* Goodbudget
* Simple
* PocketGuard
* Chip
This search also led me to a second [website](https://researchguides.austincc.edu/c.php?g=327686&p=5246378) with even more budgetting apps:
* Mvelopes
* Pocket Expense Personal Finance
* Expensify
  
After finding all the **software** I needed to build my website, I started trying to find **hardware**.
My first google search was: **Hardware used in Finance**, which led to [this website](https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/finance-products/technology-finance-hardware-software/), which contained a lot of hardware that people in finance might use:
* VOIP terminals
* Routers
* UPS
* Delivery
* LCD displays
* Epos
* Signage
* Interactive boards
