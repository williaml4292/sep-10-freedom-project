# Entry 2: Finding Software and Hardware used in Finance
##### 11/4/24

### Software and Hardware in Finance
When I first started trying to find software and hardware used in finance, I had difficulty finding software, as most of the time, I really didn't want to include the information I found into my future website.  
My first google search was: **Finance + Software**, however it led to sites with _advertisements_ all over them, so I skipped them.  
My second search was: **What software is used in Finance? .edu**. This search actually led to [a website](https://online.sbu.edu/news/finance-tools) that contained many different tools that are used in Finance.   
These include:
* Bloomberg Terminal
* Tableau
* SAP
However, I probably will not include these on my website, as although **tools** are extremely similar to **software**, they are, in the end, not the same.  
My third search was: **What apps are used in Finance? .edu**. In this search, I managed to find [this website](https://post.edu/blog/10-best-budgeting-apps-for-college-students/), which
contained many different budgetting apps such as:
* Mint
* Wally
* Personal Capital
* EveryDollar
* Albert
* Dollarbird
* Goodbudget
* Simple
* PocketGuard
* Chip
This search also led me to a [second website](https://researchguides.austincc.edu/c.php?g=327686&p=5246378) with even more budgetting apps:
* Mvelopes
* Pocket Expense Personal Finance
* Expensify
  
After finding all the **software** I needed to build my website, I started trying to find **hardware**.
My first google search was: **Hardware used in Finance**, which led to [this website](https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/finance-products/technology-finance-hardware-software/), which contained hardware that people in finance might use:
* VOIP terminals
  * Allows people to make calls over broadband internet connections instead of using a standard phone call.
* Routers
  * These are mainly used in businesses
* UPS
  * A delivery sevice
* Epos
  * Stands for Electronic Point of Sale, used by businesses
* Signage
  * Something used to market a product

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am currently in the second step of the EDP, which is to _research the problem_. At first, I started off with learning about personal budgetting apps and software, then I started researching more about the different hardware used in finance. I hope that more people would be able to use personal budgetting apps to manage their money and to avoid going into debt or wasting money. The next step would be to brainstorm possible solutions for my problem. I plan to look into the budgetting apps I found more closely and to recommend a few on my website.

### Skills
Some skills that I have developed since the previous blog include: **debugging** and having a **growth mindset**.
#### Debugging
A skill that I have learned is **debugging**. When I was learning the uses of `padding` and `margin`, as stated in my _CSS writeup_, I had to tinker in [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) to find out what they did.
