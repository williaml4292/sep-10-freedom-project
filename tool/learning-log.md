# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Jekyll**

---

### 3/3/25:
* Learning how to make layouts.
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQsGdCWv4I
* Write layouts in .html
* {{ content }} variable that is all the content in your post.
* You can add font matter to a layout to have multiple layouts in a post.
### 3/4/25:
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/
 * _includes is a directory you can make in /root that allows you to use:
  * {% include footer.html %} Includes content from a file inside of _includes
  * {% include_relative somedir/footer.html %} Includes content from a file relative to the current file.
   * Does not work with ../
 * https://github.com/brianmueller/cssi-curriculum is not a tutorial for Jekyll (Spent half the period going through this)
* Layouts are especially useful many files need the same exact html. (nav bar, footers, headers, etc)
* Next steps: Making a separate nav bar at the side and (maybe) adding SEP notes into Jekyll.
 * Should also learn how to make the local repository into remote.
